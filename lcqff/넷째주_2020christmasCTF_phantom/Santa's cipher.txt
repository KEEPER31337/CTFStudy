To protect Christmas gifts from thieves, our security manager decided to introduce a new cipher system.
In this system, Blowfish algorithm with ECB mode is used and its initial value is set to 0.
Secret information is included things like the password of the safe.
The details are as follows :
 
 
Encryption
1. Prepare randomly generated 8-byte keys, K1, K2.
2. p = base64.decode(plaintext).
3. Perform C1 = Blowfish.encrypt(K1, p).
4. Perform C2 = Blowfish.encrypt(K2, C1).
5. Perform ciphertext = base64.encode(C2).
 
 
Decryption
1. Prepare K1, K2.
2. c = base64.decode(ciphertext).
3. Perform D2 = Blowfish.decrypt(K2, c).
4. Perform D1 = Blowfish.decrypt(K1, D2).
5. Perform plaintext = base64.encode(D1).
 
 
Here are two examples.
1. plaintext: "QUJDREVGR0g="             ciphertext: "J8LFHyoEuoo="
2. plaintext: "MTIzNDU2Nzg="             ciphertext: "BO9qLlWi45U="
 
 
K1 and K2 were secretly sent to all of the santas.
Be careful not to expose the keys.
